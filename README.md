Description:

The purpose of this project is to provide an online web-based environment for primary education students to learn class material or classes of interest. The site is modeled after KhanAcademy, which is vastly known to be an educational site for students. Known to none, KhanAcademy was started in 2004 by Salman Khan as a series of lectures provided on Youtube. It was not until 2009 that Khan was able to quit his job and commit fulltime to online tutoring. Similarly, our vision is to start small, but to provide an excellent learning environment for the material that we do provide. 

Our vision starts with lessons cattered towards primary education students. As of now, it is not meant for those of higher education or AP credit students. Our lessons shall be short, fun, and interactive. Students will be captured by our site's pictures, interactive resources, and mini-games designed to optimize learning. 


Vision Statement:

Veni, Vidi, Didici.

To protect students from agitation,

To provide students with information,

To denounce the boredoms of class and lectures,

To extend knowledge to the world with facts.


Motivation:
 
The idea for this project came from KhanAcademy. However, we realize that KhanAcademy is missing a certain market that we can fulfill, aka kids. Youtube videos are not sufficient to capture the attention of elemenary and middle school students. Young kids do not want to sit for 20 minutes and watch intensely on what someone else is doing/trying to show. Similarly, classrooms fail to provide an environment of interaction. Students get bored and will become frustrated when they fall behind. Today's youth are very technologically inclined. They are willing to use the web to look up stuff and learn. Parents who access our website are mostly those who wants to get their child up to pace and some few seeking to get their child ahead of the curve. Those who fall behind in class will primarily be those who have trouble focusing on the long lectures and rants by teachers. This is where our site is most effective, for we are an interactive site that will keep the students engaged. 


Risks What are the known risks that may prevent your team from completing:

1. Our group size is only four people, thus we have stressed resources. Maybe not all that is intended will be finished on time.
2. Our design/programming experience are limited. None has developed an app before. Few experience in web developement. In addition to designing our product, we have to learn the means to do so. 
3. Miscommunication resulting in a unfurnished product. 

Risk Mitigation Plan:

1. We only have four people, so we chose a product that is very agile is both specification and possibilities. Our site is designed to be a prototype for a learning environment, and thus we do not need many lessons included on our website. Finishing one-two lessons + a homepage is definitely well within our capabilities, but we have potential to expand to more subjects/lessons if time avails. 

2. Since we are new to app design, we chose a product designed with HTML/CSS/Javascript and SQL that is covered partly by class. This means we don't need to learn new languages in order design an app. However, in order for our site to look professional, research and further experimentation is necessary. In the worst case scenario, we already have the basic knowledge to program a prototype that serves our purpose.

3. The programming is done mostly individually, but our product needs to be put together in the end where the code for our pages is synced together. Miscommunication can result in duplicates of same topic or incomplete requisites( for ex: someone codes a quiz and was expecting someone else to code the learning environment but failed to communicate this through). In order to coordinate well as to avoid wasted resources, open discussion and communication is needed from the team. 

Version Control:

Our team will be using Github for version control. 

Development Method:

We will be using Agile/Scrum as our project requires us to be as flexible as possible

Collaboration Tool: 

Currently, we are using text messaging and Github for communication. 

Proposed Architecture:

We plan on using a MySQL database on the backend of the project to store data to be displayed to the user. We plan on using simple web-development technologies such as Atom and Subversion on the front end. The database and web component will communicate via a server such as apache Tomcat. The database will hold information for the academic lessons and quizzes, and the webpage will be the main way the user interacts with the app to learn the content and take the quizzes.

Description:

The purpose of this project is to provide an online web-based environment for primary education students to learn class material or classes of interest. The site is modeled after KhanAcademy, which is vastly known to be an educational site for students. Known to none, KhanAcademy was started in 2004 by Salman Khan as a series of lectures provided on Youtube. It was not until 2009 that Khan was able to quit his job and commit fulltime to online tutoring. Similarly, our vision is to start small, but to provide an excellent learning environment for the material that we do provide. 

Our vision starts with lessons cattered towards primary education students. As of now, it is not meant for those of higher education or AP credit students. Our lessons shall be short, fun, and interactive. Students will be captured by our site's pictures, interactive resources, and mini-games designed to optimize learning. 


Vision Statement:

Veni, Vidi, Didici.

To protect students from agitation

To provide students with information

To denounce the boredoms of class and lect. 

To extend knowledge to the world with facts.


Motivation:
 
The idea for this project came from KhanAcademy. However, we realize that KhanAcademy is missing a certain market that we can fulfill, aka kids. Youtube videos are not sufficient to capture the attention of elemenary and middle school students. Young kids do not want to sit for 20 minutes and watch intensely on what someone else is doing/trying to show. Similarly, classrooms fail to provide an environment of interaction. Students get bored and will become frustrated when they fall behind. Today's youth are very technologically inclined. They are willing to use the web to look up stuff and learn. Parents who access our website are mostly those who wants to get their child up to pace and some few seeking to get their child ahead of the curve. Those who fall behind in class will primarily be those who have trouble focusing on the long lectures and rants by teachers. This is where our site is most effective, for we are an interactive site that will keep the students engaged.

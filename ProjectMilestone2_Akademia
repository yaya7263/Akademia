Project Milestone 2
Akademia

Project Dashboard:
  The project management tool can be accessed from Trello: https://trello.com/b/4ipJSQUs/product-backlog.
  This tool will capture the functional requirements and user requirements in the product backlog board.


Project Plan:

Completing the basic requirements of our project should take three two-week sprints.

  Sprint 1: Change content on main page and content page to be relevant to the product.
            Create a database to store the math page tutorial activity content (Table 1) and quiz answers (Table 2).
            Connect database to site using a server and php.
  Sprint 2: Add tutorial content to the math page.
            Add quiz content and get database to connect to user inputs on the site.
            Create an "about page" that links from the main page to talk about the product.
  Sprint 3: Use CSS to make site more appealing after functionality is done.
            Possibly add more content pages (ex: Science/Reading) after math page is finished.
            Perform unit testing on functionality of math page.
